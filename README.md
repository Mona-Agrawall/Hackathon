# Uni-Connect

Welcome to **Uni-Connect**, a front-end web application designed to help students seamlessly navigate the complex process of finding the perfect college, especially those interested in studying abroad.

## Project Overview

**Uni-Connect** is my first hackathon project, built as part of a hackathon event. The goal of this platform is to provide a user-friendly interface where students who have recently graduated from school or college can easily find and apply to universities that match their preferences based on location, course, budget, and other filters.

## Features

- **College Search with Filters**: Students can filter colleges based on:
  - Preferred course of study
  - Location (country, region)
  - Budget range
  - Additional preferences such as college type, size, etc.

- **Guidance on Application Process**: Uni-Connect provides detailed information on:
  - How to apply to specific colleges
  - When to apply (deadlines, intake schedules)
  - Prerequisites for applying (tests, documents, etc.)

## Target Audience

Uni-Connect primarily targets students seeking to apply to colleges abroad. It simplifies the search process and provides valuable resources for planning their academic journey.

## Technology Stack

This project is a **frontend-only** web application built using:
- **HTML**
- **CSS**

## Future Enhancements

- Adding dynamic content using JavaScript for real-time data updates.
- Incorporating a backend with a database to store and manage college details.
- Integration of third-party APIs to provide up-to-date information on colleges and courses.
